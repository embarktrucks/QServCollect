# sour

* `sour/` contains Python tools for working with Sauerbraten servers and data. The base was copied from [fdChasm's Python utils for Sauerbraten](https://github.com/fdChasm). He or she didn't attach a license to their code, but I've reached out about it.
* `server/` is a fork of [QServCollect](https://github.com/deathstar/QServCollect), which is an extensible Sauerbraten server written in C++.
